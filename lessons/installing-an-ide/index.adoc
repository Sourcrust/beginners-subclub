= Installing an IDE

== Introduction

In order to write code, it is recommended to use a program specifically
made for coding. An IDE is any program that code can be written on. IDE
stands for *Integrated Development Environment*. An ideal IDE would
include features such as a syntax-highlighter, a compiler, and a
debugger.

Below are two IDEs that are made for writing {cpp}:

* *Code::Blocks _(recommended)_*

** Code::Blocks works best for smaller programs and files (such as files
submitted for contests)

** Can work for Windows, Linux, and Mac

** http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26[Download Link]

*** When using Windows, install the _Code::Blocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe_

* *Visual Studio*

** Visual Studio works best for larger projects

** Requires Microsoft account

** https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/[Download Link]

This doc will walk through the usage of Code::Blocks.

== Setting up Code::Blocks

If Code::Blocks is running on Mac OS, the program will urge that command
line must be downloaded. Allow Code::Blocks to install command line.

Once Code::Blocks finishes installing, click *_Settings_* on the top
task bar, then click *_compiler…_*

On the *_Global compiler settings_* tab, ensure that *GNU GCC Compiler*
is the selected compiler. If the program is complaining that it cannot
find that compiler, click on *_Reset defaults_*.

If Code::Blocks still complains, *Google is your friend! Welcome to
Markville’s Computer Science Course :D*.

== Setting up a {cpp} File

To create a new {cpp} file, click on *_File_* on the top left corner of
the window.

* Select *_File > New > Empty File_*

Pressing pass:[<kbd>Ctrl-S</kbd>] or going to *_File > Save_* will save your code. When
saving, *ensure that the file name of your code ends with `.cpp` and not
`.c`.* The extension defines whether the document is a C file or a {cpp}
file. A lot of material in this course cannot be used in a C file.

Pressing pass:[<kbd>F2</kbd>] or going to *_View > Logs_* will display an extra window on
the screen. This screen will be important for debugging code.

On the empty file, there should be line numbers shown on the left. If
the line numbers do not show for some reason, go to *_Settings > Editor
> Other editor settings_* and check the box with *_Show line numbers_*
beside it.

== In Summary:

* An IDE is a program that allows users to write and execute code

* Visual Studio and Code::Blocks are common IDEs
