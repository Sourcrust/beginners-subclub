= An Introduction to Variables

Goal: To be able to incorporate variables with outputs and operators

== What is a Variable?

Consider a folder that is used to store a sheet of paper. This folder
can only hold one sheet of paper at a time. The folder is given a name,
and the information inside of the folder can be accessed and referred to
if the name of the folder is known. The contents of the folder could be
changed at any time and all previous information that was kept in the
folder is thrown out.

A variable works similar to the folder in this analogy. A computer has a
storage system inside that is called *memory*. Parts of memory can be
used to store data and information for later use. A variable sets
up/allocates a section of memory to be used in a file. Only one piece of
data can be stored in a section of memory at a given time. The data
located in the memory can be changed and accessed at any given time so
long as the address/the variable storing the memory is known.

In general, variables are a means of storing data. Without variables and
memory, the computer has no way of storing any information that is
given.

== Parts of a Variable

A variable consists of many components. Most notably, variables will
always have a *name* and a *type*.

Normally, memory will be accessed by having an address. This address is
expressed as a hexadecimal number (A minor inconvenience for humans to
read). Variable names are simply labels that humans use to refer to data
located in a part of memory. A code file will typically refer to
specific parts of memory by using variable names. Using the folder
analogy, the name will simply be the name of the folder.

A variable type tells the computer what type of data this variable will
be receiving. Each variable type in {cpp} has their own format and takes
up a certain amount of memory. That being said, it is important for the
computer to know whether it is working with integers or characters. A
variable cannot store a piece of data that is of a different type nor
can it change type altogether.

There are many types of variables available for {cpp}, but below is a list
of the most prominent variable types in {cpp}

[cols=",a,ma",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Description |Examples
|Integers (int) |Includes positive and negative numbers. +
Does not include decimals
|42 +
-6

|Characters (char) |Letters, numbers, all
http://www.asciitable.com/[ASCII] Characters |&

|Floating Numbers (float) |Floating numbers are basically real numbers. +

Always use *integers over floating numbers* whenever possible. Integers
are more reliable and will cause less random bugs.
|3.1415 +
1.0 +
-0.1235 +

|Boolean Values (bool) |Values that are either true (1) or false (0).
This variable type takes the least memory/space.
|true +
false
|=======================================================================

For more information about theses variable types, as well as information
about other variable types, refer to the
link:/resources/beginners/syntax-references/variable-types-and-containers[Variable
Types] doc that is shared with you.

== Initializing a Variable

In order for a computer to use a variable, it should first be told that
this variable exists and it has access to it. When a computer is told to
initialize a variable, it is allocating space/making room in the *Random
Access Memory (RAM)* for the computer to quickly use to store and
retrieve data. The way a variable is initialized resembles the
following:

 <variable type> <variable name>;

The type of variable will be listed first, followed by the variable name
and a semicolon.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
//Examples of Variable Initializations
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int mark; // integer variable
    char firstInitial; // character variable
    bool isPassing; // boolean variable
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Things to avoid when thinking of variable names:

* Giving 2 variables the same name
** In this case, the computer would not know which variable is being
referred to
* Having the name of the variable be the name of a command for {cpp}
** Usually variable names and commands are in different colours in an IDE
Variable Assignment

In order to store data into a variable, an equal sign (`=`) operator is
used in {cpp}.

 variableName = dataValue;

The variable to assign is placed on the left side of the equal sign and
a value/expression is placed on the right side. The expression on the
right side will be evaluated and the value is stored into the variable.
If the variable already has data stored in it, *that data will be
overwritten* with the new value it is given.

NOTE: All characters in a code file must be enclosed by [.underline]#single# quotation marks. (`''`)

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
using namespace std;

int main(){
    char c;
    c = 'A'
    bool checked;
    checked = false;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

== Accessing a Variable

Putting the variable name into the code will have the computer access
the data stored in that variable. When variables are used in an
expression, the variable name in the code will be substituted with the
value that the variable is storing, and the expression will be
evaluated. If the computer attempts to access data in a variable when
there is no data assigned, it will return a garbage number, a number
that has no relevancy.

**Example Code:**

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, num2;      // multiple variables of the same type can be
                        // initialized at once.
                        // variables must be separated by commas
    num = 5;
    num2 = num + 4;     // num2 = (5) + 4       num2 = 9
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Since the value on the right side of the assignment will be evaluated
before it is assigned into the variable on the left side, the same
variable can appear on both sides of the assignment.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;            // initializes variable
    num = 6;
    num = num + 1;      // 6 + 1 = 7
    num = num * num;    // 7 * 7 = 49
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Like output commands, ensure that variable initialization and
assignments all end with a semicolon.

NOTE: There are [.underline]#no such things as equations in code.# Having an equal
sign does not mean that the left side is equal to the right side. It is
simply assigning the variable on the left side to the value on the right
side.

== In Summary:

* Computers keep data in their internal storage system called memory
* Variables allocates some memory in your RAM in order to store data
* Variables always come with a type and a name
* Before using a variable, they must first be initialized through variable
initialization
* Values can be assigned to a variable using the equal operator (`=`)
* Expressions on the right side of a variable assignment may include
operators and variables
* Trying to access data from a variable when no data is assigned will
return a garbage value

== Practice Questions:

* Create a .cpp file called swap.cpp that has 2 variables, `a = 10` and `b =
1`
** Your goal is to swap the values of the 2 variables and output them
without putting `a = 10` or `b = 1`

== Further Reading for Variables

Variable initialization and variable assignment can be combined into one
line like so.

{% highlight cpp %}
int num = 8;
int num2 (8);

=== Signed Integers vs. Unsigned Integers

[.right.text-center]
image::media/image2.png[bit representation of signed integers,width=265,height=170]

A computer stores data as a string of either 0s or 1s called *bits*. The
more memory a data value needs, the more bits are required to store that
data. Eight bits make up a *byte*, and an integer uses up 4 bytes of
memory. An integer variable uses enough bits to have each permutation of
0s and 1s represent a unique integer. When an integer variable is
stored, the first bit is always used to indicate whether the integer is
positive or negative. Integers that can be positive or negative are
called signed integers.

Sometimes, integers may be used in ways so that they will never become
negative. This makes the one bit storing the sign of the integer quite
wasteful. *Unsigned integers omit the possibility of having negative
numbers.* The bit that is used from storing the sign will instead be
used to store more positive numbers. Overall, unsigned integers are not
necessary, but they can maximize the effectiveness of a variable with
the same amount of memory.

=== Long Long and Shorts

An int variable is able to store any number from `-2 147 483 648` to `2 147
483 647`. If the data values being used get so large that it exceeds the
range of an int variable, another variable type would be used. *Long
long* are variable types that take up *twice as much memory* than an int
type. Because of that, it is able to store integers from `-9 quintillion`
to `9 quintillion`. Since this data type does take up more memory than int
types, it is advised not to use long longs unless absolutely necessary.

A *short* is a variable integer type that takes up *less memory* than an
int variable type. Understandably, a short can only store integers from
`-32 768` to `32 767`. Both long long and short variable types can be signed
or unsigned.

=== Assignment Operators

The equal sign belongs to the collection of operators called *assignment
operators.* These operators are used to assign data to variables and
they are all modified versions of the basic operator `=`.

The following is a list of most of the assignment operators.

[cols=",m,,m,m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Syntax |Description |Example |Equivalent Operation
|Addition Assignment |+= |Adds the current data value with another |x +=
3 |x = x + 3

|Subtraction Assignment |-= |Subtracts the current data value with
another |x -= 4 |x = x - 4

|Multiplication Assignment |*= |Multiplies the current data value with
another |x *= 2 |x = x * 2

|Division Assignment |/= |Divides the current data value with another |x
/= 5 |x = x / 5

|Modulo Assignment |%= |Takes the remainder when the current data value
is divided by another value |x %= 3 |x = x % 3

|Increment |++ |Increases the current data value by 1 |x++ |x += 1

|Decrement |-- |Decreases the current data value by 1 |x-- |x -= 1
|=======================================================================

Although useful, these operators are not required when writing a
program. However, these operators are often used in code to help with
readability.
