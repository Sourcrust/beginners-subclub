= Loop Structures

Goal: To be able to implement While and For loops into code

== Introduction

A loop is a mean of control flow where certain commands are repeated
multiple times. They are used whenever similar actions are performed
numerous times. The number of times and when to stop repeating can be
controlled and can differ based on the values of variables.

== While Loops

The while loop is the most basic type of loop structure in C++. They are
formatted as follows:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
while (condition) {
    // commands to loop if condition is true
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Once the program enters a while loop, it will check the condition stated
in parenthesis. *If the condition results to true, then everything in
the braces will be executed.* Once everything in the braces is executed,
the program will move back to the beginning of the loop structure and
check whether the condition still results to true or not. If the
condition still results true, then the whole looping process repeats. If
the condition results false, then the program will move down to any
commands after the while loop.

As long as the condition in parenthesis remains true, *the program will
endlessly loop inside of the while loop.*

**Sample Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int counter = 0;
    // if condition returns false, go to line 10
    while (counter < 3) {   // checks if the counter is below 3
        counter++;          // adds one to the counter
        cout << counter << endl;
    }                       // after looping, it goes back to line 6
    cout << "End";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

In the previous example, a counter variable was initialized and the
program will continue to loop and increase the counter by 1 when the
counter is less than 3. Once the condition results false, it moves out
of the while loop to the remaining code on Line 10.

Apart from having the condition at the beginning of a while loop, a
command known as *break* tells the program to immediately exit the
current loop it is in. Break can be combined with an if statement so
that the program can leave the loop if the condition in the if statement
is met.

The following code will have the same outputs as the code above:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int counter = 0;         // initializes counter variable
    while (true) {           // condition will always return true
        if (counter >= 3) {  // exit condition
            break;           // goes immediately to line 13
        }
        counter++;           // adds one to the counter
        cout << counter << endl;
    }                        // goes back to line 6
    cout << "End";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

== For Loops

In the examples above, a counter variable was manually made in order to
use the while loop. Typically, while loops are not used when the program
loops a known number of times. For loops are also known as *counted
loops* because it is *made to have a counter variable.* The format of
the for loop resembles the following.

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
for (int counterVariable; condition; changetoCounter) {
    // commands while condition above is true
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

The section in parentheses are divided into three groups

* The first part initializes the counter variable to be used for the
entire loop structure
** Variable names for counters are often `i` or `j`
* The second part is the condition that usually includes the counter
variable.
** If the condition results true, the program goes through the for loop
** If the condition results false, the program will exit the for loop
* The third part is the changes the counter variable goes through each
time the program loops

NOTE: Notice how each section is divided by semicolons.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // set counter, i, to 3
    for (int i = 3; i > 0; i--) { // if i <= 0, go to line 9
        cout << i << endl;
    }   // goes back to line 6 and subtracts 1 to i
    cout << "End";
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
3
2
1
End
....

On line 6, a counter was created and set to 3 to start off. The program
continued to loop, and the counter kept decrementing by one until the
counter was 0, and the condition results false.

== Brief Introduction to Scope

In C++, scope refers to a specific region in code that are *surrounded
by braces.* For example, the *main function* is its own scope and it can
nest smaller scopes if it had loop or if structures in it. Braces act as
*barriers* for variables. Chapter 8 warned how a variable cannot be
initialized in an if structure and used outside of the if structure.
This is because any initialized variable cannot be used outside of the
scope it was initialized in.

When a variable is initialized in a smaller scope (Ex: a loop), a place
in memory is made and no other variable can be created with the same
name as that variable. That variable is able to be accessed within
smaller scopes and can be used any time so long as the program is still
at the scope the variable was initialized in. When the program leaves
that scope (Ex: when it leaves a loop), *all variables initialized
inside that scope are destroyed* and space in the memory is freed. This
means that a variable initialized in the smaller scope *no longer
exists*. This also means that *another variable with the exact same name
can be made*.

This is why properly indenting code is important. Indentations show
where exactly variables are able to be used and when they will be
destroyed. It also shows how each scope nests within larger scopes. The
number of indents a command has represents the number of nested scopes
there are.

On the example code on the next page, there are two different instances
where variable `i` is initialized. However, since they were not declared
in the same scope, the *two variables did not co-exist*. Instead, the
second `i` variable was initialized when the first `i` variable was
already destroyed.

**Demonstration of Scopes:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// pay attention to all the indents
int main() {
    // variable declared in the scope of the main fcn
    int var = 0;
    // counter declared in the scope of the for loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cout << i << endl;
        var++;
    }
    // i no longer exists, but var still exists
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        // i now exists again, since it was reinitialized
        cout << i << endl;
        var++;
    }
    // i no longer exists... again
    cout << var;   // outputs total number of loops
    return 0;
}
// var does not exist anymore
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
0
1
2
0
1
2
6
....

== In Summary

* While loops and for loops are used to have the program repeat the same
commands multiple times
* The program will leave the while loop once the condition in the while
loop results false
* For loops include a counter variable as well as an if condition
* A for loop is for counted loops and a while loop is for non-counted
loops
* Break can be used on both loops to end the looping procedure
* Variables cannot be used outside of the scope the variable has been
initialized in

== Further Reading on Loops Structures

=== Do-While Loops

Do-while loops are modified while loops. They makes sure that *the
program runs everything in the loop structure at least once*. The
condition for looping is checked at the very end of the loop structure
and not at the beginning. The syntax of the do-while loop is the
following:

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
do{
    //code to be executed atleast once
} while (condition);
{% endhighlight %}
++++

=== Extra Information on For Loops and Nested Loops

Nothing between the parenthesis in a for loop are required for a for
loop to run. (except the semicolons) The for loop does not need an exit
condition or a variable initialization. This allows the for loop to be
more flexible as a counter variable can be initialized and used inside
and outside of the scope of the for loop.

When a loop is found inside of another loop, the inner loop is known as
a *nested loop*. Nesting loops are commonly used in code. When the
*break* command is used inside of a nested loop, the program will *exit
the innermost loop* that it is currently in. That means, the program did
not exit the larger loop yet and will require a separate break
statement.

An demonstration of how for loops can be used and how nested loops works
are shown below.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 0;    // counter variable pre-initialized
    for (; i < 3;) {
    // this for loop can be replaced with a while loop
    // since there is not increase nor initialization
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            // nests another loop if line 9 results true
            for (int j = 0;; j++) {      // no condition
                if (j == 3){
                    break;              //go to line 16
                }
                cout << i << " " << j << endl;
            }
        }
        i++; // counters can be modified within the loop
    }
    // variable i can still be used because it was not
    // initialized inside of the for loop
    return 0;
}
