= Functions

Goal: To be able to create and call functions

== What is a Function?

A function in computer science works exactly like a function in
mathematics. The purpose of a function is to take data inputs,
manipulate them, and return an output. Functions *can have multiple
inputs,* but can only return *one output. *

Functions have been used throughout the course. Whenever a function is
needed, a *function call* is placed in the code. An example of a
function is the square root (`sqrt()`) function. This function will always
return the positive square root of a given value.

All functions will have a *function name and parameters*. In the square
root function, “sqrt” would be the function name. Functions can only be
called when the name of the function is known. When using the square
root function, the value to be square rooted is the input. This input
value is called a *parameter.* Parameters are always placed between the
parenthesis in the function. Notice how the square root function takes
an input, and only returns one output. This output is called a *return
value* and is found in most functions.

Square root is one of many common functions that are used in C++. A list
of commonly used functions can be found
link:/resources/beginners/commonly-used-functions-in-cpp[here].

Another example of a function is the *main function*, the location where
all code so far is written in. The layout of the main function will be
viewed in more depth.

== Creating a Function

So far, every function used in this course were member functions already
made and placed in a library. Those functions are only for general use.
If needed, multiple functions can be created and specifically used in a
code file.

A new function must first be declared and defined before it can be used.
The function declaration and the code that makes up the function are
placed *outside and before the main function*. A function cannot have
another function inside of it. The general outline for a function
declaration will resemble the following:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
ReturnType FunctionName(Parameters) {
    // code to be performed
    return returnValue;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

When a function is called in the main function, the program will
*perform all code* in the called function before it resumes where it
left off in the main function.

The return type will be the data type that the function will output. A
function *should always have a return statement.* (`return returnValue;`)
Notice how there is a return statement in the main function. (`return 0;`)
The return value will be the value the function will output. A function
cannot output a data value that is a different type than the type listed
at the beginning of the function. Any data type and container can be the
return type of a function.

Below is a list of common return value types in C++

[cols="a,",options="header"]
|=============================================
|Return Type |Description
|`void`      |Has no return value
|`int`       |Returns an integer
|`bool`      |Returns a boolean value (true or false)
|`char`      |Returns a character
|=============================================

The main purpose of a function is to output a return value. Once the
program reaches a return statement, *the program will immediately leave
the function* with that return value. This is why all code must be
placed after the return 0; in the main function. Once the program
reaches return 0;, it will immediately leave the main function with the
value of 0. A function could have multiple return statements; however, a
function will never return multiple values.

Just because functions are made to return a data value, it does not mean
that they are unable to do anything else. Functions can have output and
input statements. *Functions can even call other functions.* If a
function is called within another function, the program will first work
through the function most recently called.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

// returns an integer, output3 is the function name
int output3() {
    // sqrt function is called, that program will call sqrt(9) and return 3
    return sqrt(9); // program will go to line 13 with the value of 3
    cout << "This message will never be outputted";
    // This output statement is placed after the return statement
}

int main() { // main function
    cout << output3() << endl; // calls the output3 function (line 6)
    cout << "End of Program."; // resumes executing code in main fcn
    return 0;                  // return value of 0
    cout << "This message will also never be outputted";
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
3
End of Program.
....

== Parameters

Parameters are all the input values that go into a function. The return
value in a function should depend on the parameters that are given. This
means that different input values should give different return values.
The parameters that a function receives are defined in between the
parentheses of the function declaration. A list of parameters for a
function is called a *parameter list*. All parameters in a function will
have a data type and a parameter name. A parameter list is formatted as
follows:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
returnType FunctionName(p1DataType p1Name, p2DataType p2Name ...) {}
// the number of parameters in the function could continue
{% endhighlight %}
++++

Parameters are separated by commas and are declared as if they were
variables. In fact, parameters can be used almost like variables.
Parameters must have both a data type as well as a parameter name. When
using parameters in a function, *the data* *values of these parameters
cannot be changed.* (This will be covered further on in the chapter).

Parameters and return values are the only things that are passed between
functions. All code in a function is completely independent from all
other functions. That means that a function will always have its own
individual scope. This is important to note when regarding possible
parameter or variable names.

Remember how two variable names *in the same scope* cannot have the same
variable name. However, since each function has its own individual
scope, a variable/parameter that is declared in a function can have the
same name as a variable located in another function. The location in
memory that the program will look at when it uses a variable depends on
what scope the program is currently in.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// notice how a and b are parameter/variable names in all 3 functions
// but there will never be multiple a's and b's in the same scope

// two integer parameters are given, in the scope, there are a and b
int subtract(int a, int b) { // a = 10, b = 5
    // evaluates a-b, then ends function and goes to line 21
    return a - b; // 10 - 5 = 20
}

// another function. remember, in C++, scope is shown with braces and indents
int add(int a, int b) { // a = 5, b = 10
    // evaluates a+b, then function ends, program goes to line 21
    return a + b; // 10 + 5 = 15
}

int main() { // main function, the program will always start with this
    int a=5, b=10; // initializes two variables, a and b
    // evaluates the expression before outputting
    cout << add(a,b) + subtract(b,a);
    return 0; // returns 0 and program ends
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
20
....

In the code above, the program will start off in the main function.
Variables `a` and `b` are created in the main function. On line 21,
the program will first call the add function with parameters `a` and
`b`. The values of `a` and `b` are passed into the add function as
integer parameters. For clarification, the value of `a` in the main
function will be stored in parameter `a` in the add function. Whenever
`a` and `b` are referred to in the add function, the program always
refers to the parameters, `a` and `b`. The add function will end up
returning 15.

The program will then move back to the main function where it then calls
the subtract function. Notice how variables, `a` and `b`, are
flipped on line 21. This means that the value of `b` in the main
function will be stored in parameter `a` in the subtract function.
Likewise, the value of `a` in the main function will be stored in
parameter `b` in the subtract function. When the subtract function is
called, parameter `a` has a value of 10, and parameter `b` has a value
of 5. Thus, the program evaluates 10 - 5 on line 9. The subtract
function will return 5, and that value will add with 15 on line 21. In
the end, the program will output the value of 20.

The concept of functions can be very difficult to learn. That is why
some mid-chapter practice questions are added to this chapter to help
reinforce your understanding of functions.

* Write a program called maximum.cpp. Have the main function create a *ten
element integer array,* and allow users to input values in the array.
After that, have the main function call another function called
`findMax()`. This function will take an array and *return the largest
value found in the array.* Have the main function output the max value.
* Modify maximum.cpp so that the code asking for user inputs is placed in
another function called `getInputs()`. *`getInputs()` will ask for a value
and return the user input.* The main function will call `getInputs()` *ten
separate times.*
* Add another function called *findOccurences().* This function will take
a value and *return how many times that value appears in the array.*
Have the main function ask for a value and then call findOccurences().
* Jimbob made some more code and it *looks so convoluted.* Jimbob bets
that you would not be able to predict the outcome of his code. (which is
something he *should not* brag about) Your job is to prove him wrong.
Predict what Jimbob’s code will output *without running it on
Code::Blocks.*

    return subtract(x, a) + add(c, x);

    cout << change(y, z, x) + add(x, y);
    return 0;
}

== Passing by Value Versus Passing by Reference

In all previous examples of code, all the parameters in a function were
*passed by value*. The *values of all inputs were copied* and given to
the parameters to be used. The values of the parameters *cannot be
changed* as *parameters are not variables.*

Functions are limited by the number of values that could be passed back
and forth. Even though many values can be passed into a function as
parameters, a function can only return one value (That’s the definition
of a function). Consider a function that swaps the values of two input
variables. This function will end up needing to change two parameters,
something that cannot be done when the parameters were passed by value.
This is why parameters can also pass by reference.

Passing by reference is when parameters are *given an address instead of
a value*. This address refers to a specific location in memory that
stores data. That way, a location in memory can be accessed and
manipulated across multiple functions. Parameters passed by reference
can be used just like a variable. To make a parameter pass by reference,
a `&` is placed *before* the parameter name:

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// void has no return value, but a and b are passed by reference
// parameter 'a' acts as variable x, and parameter 'b' acts as variable y
void fun(int &a, int &b) {
    a=1; // the memory that 'a' refers to is changed to 1
    b=2;
    // outputs the values of a and b during the call
    cout << "During Call: " << endl;
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;
}

int main() {
    // 2 locations in memory are made and given data values
    int x = 5, y = 7;
    // outputs values of x and y before the call
    cout << "Before Call: " << endl;
    cout << x << " " << y << endl;
    // calls fun, the address of variable x is passed to the function
    // the address of variable b is passed to the function
    fun(x, y);
    // outputs the values of x and y after the call
    cout << "After Call: " << endl;
    cout << x << " " << y;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
Before Call:
5 7
During Call:
1 2
After Call:
1 2
....

In the previous example, the address of variables x and y were passed by
reference when the fun function was called. Any assignment to parameters
a and b will change the data values of variables x and y in the main
function.

Usually, a computer is quicker when passing by value as it would take
less time to copy a value than use an address. Smaller data types such
as integers will always be passed by value when there is no `&` before
the parameter name. This makes an integer a *scalar data type*. It is
easy for a computer to make a copy of a scalar data type because scalar
data types are often small in size.

Some data types are larger in size and are not scalar data type. For
example, arrays are often so large that passing by value would take more
time than passing by reference. This is why containers such as *arrays
and vectors are automatically passed by reference*.

Some scalar data types include *integers, characters, strings. booleans,
and floats*.

Some non-scalar data types that automatically pass by reference include
*arrays and vectors*.

== Recursion

In previous examples that involve functions, there were moments where
functions were called within another function. The program will finish
executing the function most recently called before executing all other
functions. Not only can functions call other functions, but *a function
can call itself*. The process of having a function call itself is called
recursion.

A function would call itself the same way it could call any other
function. Recursion can function similar to a loop because of how the
same code is repeated multiple times. Unlike actual loops, there is a
limit on how many times a function could recurse. A function cannot call
itself forever because each function call takes up new memory.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// This function will find terms in the fibonacci sequence. 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
// term 1 and term 2 has the value of 1.
// the next term in the sequence will always be the sum of the previous 2 terms
// creates recursive function that returns a term in the fibonacci series
int fib(int term) {     // term represents the term number in the series
    if (term < 3) {     // term 2 = 1, term 1 = 1
        return 1;
    }
    else {              // all other terms are the sum of previous 2 terms
        return fib(term - 1) + fib(term - 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "What term of the fibonacci series do you want to find?" << endl;
    cin >> n; // gets term number
    cout << fib(n) << " is the term in the series."; // calls fibonacci
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Sample Run:**
....
What term of the fibonacci series do you want to find?
4
3 is the term in the series
....

The recursive function above calls itself to find a term in the
fibonacci sequence. Since all terms in the fibonacci sequence will be
the sum of the two previous terms, the function will call itself to find
the values of those two previous terms. Eventually, this recursive
procedure will continue until it adds the first and the second terms of
the fibonacci sequence.

This recursive process can be modelled using function notation in
mathematics.

++++
\[
\begin{aligned}
fib(4)
&= fib(4 - 1) + fib(4 - 2)
&= fib(3) + fib(2) \\
&= (fib(3 - 1) + fib(3 - 2)) + 1 \\
&= (fib(2) + fib(1)) + 1 \\
&= (1 + 1) + 1 \\
&= (2) + 1 \\
&= 3
\end{aligned}
\]
++++

Generally, recursion would not be used to find a term in the fibonacci
sequence. Recursion will be often used in applications such as *graph
theory* (advance course material). *Do not excessively use recursion.*
If it is possible to use a loop instead of recursion, use a loop!

== In Summary

* A function is a set of code that outputs a single data value.
* A function will always have a name, a return type, and parameters
* The main function is an example of a function
* Custom made functions are placed outside of the main function (And
generally before it)
* A function can only return values of a specific data type
* Parameters are input values that should affect the return value
* All functions have their own individual scope
* Parameters can either be passed by value or passed by reference
* Scalar data values, such as integers, would normally be passed by value.
They can be passed by reference be putting a & before the parameter
name.
* Arrays and vectors are automatically passed by reference.
* Functions are able to call other functions
* Recursion is when a function calls itself repeatedly

== Practice Questions

* Create a file called swap.cpp. This file will have a function that will
swap two integer values.
Note: There are very few contest questions that require the usage of
functions. Most of those contest questions are graph theory questions,
which will be covered at a later time. That being said, below are
examples of questions that could use functions.

== Further Reading on Functions

=== Forward Declarations

For a program to be able to call another function, that function must be
declared and defined before that call. If the function is placed
somewhere after the function call, the program will not know that the
function exists. This is why libraries are included at the very
beginning of a C++ file. The program will have a list of functions it
knows and expects to only call those functions. Thus, the program cannot
tell whether a function does not exist, or is located further in the
file.

Forward declarations are used to notify the program that a specific
function exists somewhere in the file. That way, the computer will
recognize the function when it finds a function call. When there is a
forward declaration for a function, the program expects that the
function will later be defined. That means that a forward declaration
must be paired with the actual function.

A forward declaration in C++ resembles the following.

....
returnType functionName(p1Type p1Name, p2Type p2Name, ...);
// All parameters and their type must be listed
....

**Example Code**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// forward declaration, lets compiler know that write1 exists
void write1(int n);
// write0 alternates with write1. They both call each other a total of n times
void write0(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << 0;
        // since the program knows that write1 exists, the compiler doesn't error out
        write1(n - 1);  // goes back to write1
    }
}
void write1(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << 1;
        write0(n - 1);  // calls write0
    }
}
int main() {            // main function, program starts here
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    write1(n);          // starts by calling write1

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Sample Run:**
....
7
1010101
....

Forwards Declarations are most often used when a program alternates
between two functions

=== Global Variables

Variables can be declared outside of a function. These variables are
known as *global variables*. Variables that are declared inside of a
function are known as *local variables.* Global variables have global
scope. This means that they can be used throughout the entire C++ file.
A file is able to *have a global variable and a local variable with the
same name.* However, whenever that variable is used in a function, *the
local variable will take priority*.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// my global variables, can be used throughout the file
int a = 3;
int b = 4;
int c = 5;

int main() { // main function, program starts here
    // local variable made and take precedence over the global variable
    int a = 10;
    int d = 20;        // local variable made
    cout << a << endl; // outputs local variable
    cout << b << endl; // no local variable exists, outputs global variable
    cout << d << endl; // outputs local variable
    cout << a + b + c + d;

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
10
4
20
39
....

NOTE: *Do not get in the habit of using global variables.* In larger
projects, global variables become very dangerous as they can easily be
messed with. Using parameters over global variables is encouraged.
