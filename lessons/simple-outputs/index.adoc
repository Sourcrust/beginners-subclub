Chapter 3:

Simple Outputs

Goal: To be able display numbers and text onto a screen

In order for a computer to take a file and execute its code, it must be
told to build and run the code. On Code Blocks and Visual Studio, *press
F9* or *click the _Build and run_ option on the _Build_ drop-down menu*
to build and run a code file.

When told to build and run a file, the computer will create an .*exe
file* located alongside the .cpp file. However, .exe files cannot be
saved onto a school computer. Thus, the *.cpp file should be located on
an external hard drive* such as a *USB* when using school computers.

Running the basic skeleton listed previously will create a window
resembling the following:

This window is known as the *console.* This is the text-based interface
that accepts inputs from users and displays output values onto the
screen. (Graphics will be done at a later time.) The text from the
console shown above only appears once the computer finishes running the
file.

* `Process returned 0(0x0)` corresponds to the `return 0;` line in the main
function of the code file.
* The execution time is the amount of time the computer took to run the
program.
* Pressing any key will close the console window.

== Outputting Values

The simplest command for C++ that outputs text onto the console is the
`cout` command. `cout` is a command that is not located in the Standard
Library. Instead, it is located in the `<iostream>` library.

In order to add any library into a C++ file, add
`\#include` followed by the name of the library, at the top of the
file.

.Adding the iostream library
++++
{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
{% endhighlight %}
++++

NOTE: Along with using namespace std; all `\#include` statements should be
placed at the beginning of the file

`cout` stands for "`**C**onsole **OUT**put`", and it allows the console
to output text and numbers onto the screen. In code, the `cout` command is
formatted like so:


++++
{% highlight cpp %}
cout << Output << endl;
{% endhighlight %}
++++

The output is enclosed between two “<<” and can be one of 2 types.

* Computers could output numbers (real or integer) onto the screen
* Text (also known as string literals) can be outputted onto the screen
** String literals must be enclosed by quotation marks (`""`)

.Components of the _cout_ command:
[cols="m,"]
|=======================================================================
|cout |This marks the beginning of the output command and tells the
console that a value will be outputted
|<< a|
These symbols must be placed in between all outputs in the command. +
Tip: to remember the direction of the symbol, when looking from left to
right, the symbol goes *outwards*
|endl |This tells the console to skip to the next line. This part is not
required in the syntax of cout.
|=======================================================================

NOTE: Like _all other commands_ on C++, the cout command _must end with
a semicolon (`;`)_. This marks the end of a command for a compiler.

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>           // library with cout
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Line 1" << endl; // Text on line 1
    cout << 12;               // There is no endl
    cout << 3.45;             // outputs on 2nd line
    return 0;                 // ends program
}

{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
Line 1
123.45
....

Multiple outputs can be displayed using one command simply be separating
each output with <<. The following code has an identical output as the
code above.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Line 1" << endl << 12 << 3.45;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

== In Summary:

* Building and running a code file will create a .exe file and open a
window called a console
* The console is able to accept user inputs and display text and values
* The `cout` command tells the computer to output a value onto the console
window
* Putting `\#include <iostream>` in the file will add `cout` to the computer’s
list of known commands
* Text outputs must be enclosed by quotation marks
* All commands must end with a semicolon

== Practice Questions

*  Create a C++ file called HelloWorld.cpp that outputs “Hello, World!”
onto the screen
*  Explain the difference between the two statements and their outputs.
..  `cout << "08" << endl;`
..  `cout << 08 << endl;`
*  Predict what the console will output given the following code:
+
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "01" << endl << 12;
    cout << " " << 3.58;
    cout << endl << endl << "13";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++
