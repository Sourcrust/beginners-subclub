= Arrays

Consider having a program that stores the price of various items in a store.
This program could have an integer variable storing the price for each item in the store.
Business is bad and the store is forced to raise the price of *every item* in the store by $1.
If each price were its own integer variable, raising the price of every item would be messy.
If each price were its own variable, it would take so many lines of code to raise each price by one.

Putting the store scenario aside, there are many instances where large amounts of variables must be changed, or even compared.
Having a separate name for each variable would simply be too inconvenient for the user and the coder.

Arrays are the solution to having large amounts of similar variables.
An array is a data structure that collects and organizes variables under one name.

== Structure of an Array

.Structure of a 6-Element Integer Array
|===
|Data Value |24 |35 |46 |57 |68 |79
|Index      |0  |1  |2  |3  |4  |5
|===

An array is a container that stores variables of the same data type.
Each individual variable in an array is called an *element*. Each
element in an array is stored, organized, and *numbered* with a value
called an *index.* An element in an array can be accessed by using the
index that it is assigned. The very *first element of an array will
always be given the index of 0*. The rest of the elements are simply
numbered in order. For example, an element of index 2 would be the third
element of the array.

.Array that Stores 50 Prices
|===
|Price of item ($)      |3 |5 |6 |9 |12 |42 | &hellip; |9
a|Item number *(index)* |0 |1 |2 |3 |4  |5  | &hellip; |50
|===

Using the store scenario, an array of 50 prices would not only organize
all the values properly, but would also make the prices much easier to
work with for a computer.
When using arrays, the number of elements that are in an array will
always remain constant. This means that an element *cannot be added or
removed* from an array.

== Array Initialization and Assignments

On {cpp}, an array initialization should be formatted like the following:

[source]
DataType ArrayName[Size];

This statement will tell the computer to allocate memory for _Size_
variables of _DataType_ type. A variable can be placed where the size of
the array should be (Integer variable that is). Notice how *square
brackets (`[ ]`)* are used when working with arrays.

In order to access the value that an element in an array is storing, the
index of that variable must be known. In code, *`VariableName[n]`* would
return the variable in the array with index `n`. `VariableName[n]` refers
to a variable and *operates like any other variable.* For example,
`VariableName[0]` and `VariableName[1]` refer to two completely different
variables and can be used as two separate variables. Each element of the
array can be worked with individually.

NOTE: Initializing an array of size `n` will have its last element's
index be `n-1`. For example, initializing an array of size 50 will create
50 elements numbered from 0 to 49. There is no element with index 50.

Since the index of an array increments by one when going through each
element, arrays are often used together with for loops where the counter
variable acts as the index of the element to be looked at.

Example Code:
[source,role=linenos]
----
#include <iostream>
// Makes an array storing the first 5 even number
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // creates integer array with 5 elements in it
    int numbers[5]; // size 5
    // for loop to store a value in each element
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // gives each element in the array a value
        numbers[i] = i * 2;
    }
    cout << "Array Contains: " << endl;
    // for loop to access the value of every element
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // outputs value of each the current element
        cout << numbers[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
----

.Output:
....
Array Contains:
0 2 4 6 8
....

Notice how the counter variable `i` is also being used as an index for
the array. A for loop is the ideal method for reading through all
elements in an array.
