= Debugging Common Errors in C++

When trying to find errors in code, a debugger is often used. A debugger
allows users to find problems in their code. If the code failed and
crashed when running or compiling, a message will be displayed on the
debugger showing where and what caused the code to crash.

Code::Blocks is built with a debugger. It should naturally be located on
the bottom of the Code::Blocks window. There should be a bar with the
name, _*Logs & Others*_ on it. If there is no debugger shown on
Code::Blocks, *press F2 or go to _View_ > _Logs_*.

.An error being displayed in the *Build messages* tab. Here, we are told that the error is due to a missing semicolon on line 6.

In the debugger, the _*Build messages*_ tab will display any messages
when the computer is building/running a code file. If an error occurs,
it will display a message and the line number the error is found in. In
case you have trouble understanding what the message means, below are a
few errors beginners to that would output a build message,

== Error: redeclaration of '_____'
* Did you initialize a variable twice? Two variables should not have the
same names.

== Error: expected ';' before .....
* You simply missed a semicolon on the line right before the line that
errored.

== Error: '____' was not declared in this scope.......
* This message is a little vague
* Is the word that is not declared supposed to be a variable?
** Is that variable initialized (Check spelling)?
** Did you initialize a variable inside a loop/if structure and tried to
access that variable outside of the loop?
* Is the word that is not declared supposed to be a command?
** Did you include both the standard library as well as the library the
command is in.
*** Does your file have a “using namespace std;” and an include statement
*at the beginning* of your file?
* Is the word that is not declared supposed to be a function?
** Is there a part in your code where a function is used before the
function is declared?
*** If a function is placed after the main function, your code cannot call
the function inside the main function.
* Is the word that is not declared supposed to be text?
** Put quotation marks around them

== Fatal error: <name of library>: No such file or directory; .....
* Most likely, your file is saved as a C file and not a C++ file. In a C
file, many libraries such as string, iostream, and vectors, cannot be
used.
* Did you spell the name of the library correctly?

== Error: no match for 'operator>>'....... _or_ Error: no match for 'operator\<<'.....
* Did you mix up >> and <<? (<< are for cout statements and >> are for
input statements)

== Error: invalid operands of types 'const char[ ]' and 'const char[ ]' to
binary.......
* Did you try to add two string literals? (text that are surrounded by
quotation marks)
** Avoid doing that altogether, but if you really need to add them, just
omit the *+* sign.

== Error: no match for 'operator\<'
* _This applies to every operator_
* What happened was likely an error due to the order the computer performs
operations. For example, << is usually executed before a relational
operator in an output statement
** Just add parenthesis and see if it works

== Error: invalid operands of types '____' and '____' to 'binary operator%'........
* Did you try to perform a modulus operation when one of the values is not
an integer/character?
** If you are trying to mod a floating number, *put _(int)_* right in front
of the variable to change the floating number into an integer. However,
this will cut off any decimals stored in the float.
If your code does not crash, but it is not outputting the values that
you expect it should output, check the following:
* Did you use any assignment variables(“=”) in an if/loop condition when
you should have used a relational operator (“==”)
** Do not mix “=” and “==” up
* When you initialize a counter variable for your for loop, did you give
your counter a value?
** If not, then the value of the counter will be some garbage number.
* tAre the variables that are sent into a function as parameters the
intended variable type?

These are only a few errors that could come up when coding a C++ file.
If you are still left with an error with a build message, read through
your code once more to see if all of your code makes sense.
