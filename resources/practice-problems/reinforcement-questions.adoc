. Write a program that takes integers _n_ and _i_. Your program will
perform _i_ calculations on _n_. The calculations done on _n_ will
alternate between the following:
+
--
[lowerroman]
.. +\(n_{\text{next}} = 2(n + 4)\)+

.. +\(n_{\text{next}} = \dfrac{n + 2}{2}\)+
--
+
The program will output the final value of _n_.
+
Input: _n i_
+
Output: resulting number after performing _i_ calculations to _n_
+
Sample Input: +\(\color{red}3\)+ +\(5\)
+
Sample Output: 34

. Suppose a number of dots were used to form an equilateral triangle.
The number of dots required to make the triangle increases as the number
of rows increases. Notice how the number of dots in each row increases
by one each time. image:media/image2.png[image,width=165,height=139,role="right"]

.. The number of dots that form an equilateral triangle are called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number[triangular numbers].
In a sequence of all triangular numbers, _t(n)_, _t(n)_ would be the sum
of all natural numbers up to and including _n_; that is, _t(n)_ = 1 +
2 + 3 + … + _n_
+
There is a formula that calculates the __n__^th^ term in a sequence of
triangle numbers:
+
+\[t(n) = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\]+
+
Rewrite your program so that it now uses this formula to calculate the
number of dots in an equilateral triangle. If you have originally used
this method, then rewrite your program so that it uses loops instead.
Use the same test data as <<4(a)>>.

. The Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers where each term is the
sum of the previous two terms.
+
+\[F_{n} = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}\]+
+
Let the zeroth and first term of the Fibonacci sequence be 0 and 1,
respectively. Write a program that outputs the _n_^th^ term of the
fibonacci sequence.
+
Input: _n_
+
Output: _n_^th^ term of the Fibonacci sequence

*Hint* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#To find the _n_^th^ term in the sequence, you will start with the zeroth and first term and find all succeeding terms until you get to the _n_^th^ term.#

. The 3n+1 problem. The http://wcipeg.com/problem/3nplus1[wcipeg
page] explains this nicely.
+
*Hint* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#The number of times 3n+1 and n/2 will be calculated is unknown. A while loop would suit this question.#

You may want to use
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/erase/[string::erase]
from the string library.

Sample Run:
+
[cols="2*m",options="header",]
|==============================
|Input |Output

time, _c1_ and _c2_. Each time _c1_ is found in the string, the
character is replaced with _c2_ instead. Each time _c2_ is found in the
string, the character is replaced with _c1_.

table] instead of 26 if statements.

. Write a program that takes an entire line of characters. You will
need to use the getline() function. After receiving an entire sentence,
output the sentence with all the words reversed. Assume no punctuation
will be given in the input.
+
Sample Run:
+
[cols="2*m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================

|=======================================================================
+
*Hint* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#All words are surrounded by spaces, and spaces are also characters. The length of each word in a sentence can be found be locating all the spaces in the sentence.#

. http://wcipeg.com/problem/ccc16j3[Hidden Palindrome] is a good
contest question that you can find on WCIPEG. (Ex: In the string abcba,
bcb is a palindrome surrounded by two a’s)
+
*Hint 1* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#A palindrome is made up of a smaller palindrome surrounded by two of the same characters.#
+
*Hint 2* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#A way to check if a string is a palindrome is to start at the centre of the string and work outwards. For example, suppose _i_ is the index of the centre of the string. For the string to be a palindrome, `str[i-n]` and `str[i+n]` must be the same. This idea should be used when finding hidden palindromes.#
+
The solution to Hidden Palindrome can be found in the link:/resources/beginners/example-code/strings/HiddenPalindrome.cpp[here].

== Arrays

. Write a program that takes in an _n_ number of integer inputs. This
program will store those integers in an array and determine the greatest
number (_h_) and least number (_l_) of all the given integers.

while reversing. After reversing, output the _i^th^_ element of the
reversed array. ‘_i’_ will always be less than _n_.

.. An anagram is a rearrangement of the letters of a word/phrase to
form another word/phrase. Write a program that will determines if two
phrases are anagrams. You will need to use getline() for this question.
If the two phrases are anagrams, output "`Y`". If the two phrases are not
anagrams, output "`N`".

*Hint* (Highlight to see)*:* [hidden-highlight]#have a 26 element array that stores how many times each character appears in a string.#
.. Ragaman is a variation of the problem above. This question can be
found on the http://wcipeg.com/problem/ccc16s1[WCIPEG] website.
+
*Hint* (Highlight to show)*:* [hidden-highlight]#Since the first word will never have any asterisks, if the second word has more of one character than the first word, the two words are not ragamans.#
.. Eliminanagram is another problem that involves anagrams. This can
also be found on the http://wcipeg.com/problem/smac081p1[WCIPEG] site.
+
*Hint* (Highlight to show)*:* [hidden-highlight]#For two words to be eliminanagrams, the total number of each character found in the two words must be even.#
