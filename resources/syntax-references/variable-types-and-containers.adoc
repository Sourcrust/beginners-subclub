== Variable Types

[cols="m,,a,a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type a|Size +
(bytes) |Description |Range

|`int`
|4
|Used when the data are all integers +
Ex: 1, 2, -8, 0, -350
|-2 147 483 648 to +
2 147 483 847

|`unsigned int`
|4
|Used when the data are all positive integers and zero.
|0 to +
4 294 967 295

|`float`
|4
|Includes all real numbers. +
Ex: 1.0, 3.14, 1.2345
|

|`char`
|1
|Characters part of ASCII. Each character is stored as a numerical representation.

Ex: ‘a’,’b’,’@’

|Irrelevant if only used for ASCII

|`boolean`
|1
|Stores either true (1) or false (0)
|

|`long long`
|8
|Used when the data are very large integers that go beyond the range of an integer type
|-9 quintillion to +
9 quintillion

|`unsigned long long`
|8
|Used when the data are all very large integers that never go below 0
|0 to 18 quintillion

|`short`
|2
|Smaller range of integers, uses less memory
|-32 768 to +
32 767

|`unsigned short`
|2
|Used when the data are all small positive integers and zero
|0 to 65 535

|`double`
|8
|Used when more memory is needed for a float
