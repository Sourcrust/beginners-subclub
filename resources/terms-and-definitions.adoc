|Compiler

set of instructions that a computer could understand and follow.

|Console

values.

|Container
|A collection of variables stored under a given identifier.

|Control Flow
|The order in which a computer executes code.

|Debugger
|A program that is used to help test and debug code files.

|Documentation
|Structure of a code file. This includes whitespacing
and commenting.

|Element
|A variable inside of a container.

|Function
|A command for a computer. Typically, functions will include
inputs and result one output.

|Global Variables
|Variables that are initialized outside of a
function, they are able to be used throughout the entire {cpp} file.

|Hard Coding
|Giving values to variables directly in the code file.

|Identifier
|A name that a computer uses to refer to a specific
location in memory.

|Index
|A data value that indicates which variable is being referred to
in a container

|Integrated development Environment (IDE)
|A program that is designed
for programmers to write code.

|Library
|A file that contains a list of functions that a computer
should know.

|Local Variables
|Variables that are initialized in a function. These
variables can only be used in the function they are declared in.

|Operator
|a symbol that manipulates or compares data values (Ex:
`+`, `=`, `>`, `!`)

|Parameter
|Data Values that are sent to a function when that function
is called

|Memory
|A part in a computer that is used to store/retrieve data

|Recursion
|The process of having a function call itself

|Scalar Data Values
|Data values that take up little memory. They are
normally passed to a function by value.

|Scope
|A range/area in a code file that limits where variables can be
used in.

|Spaghetti
|A type of code that is convoluted and unnecessarily hard to read.
It is difficult to edit spaghetti code as it is prone to bugs.
Therefore, creating spaghetti code is frowned upon.

|String
|A container that stores a series of characters

|String Literal
|A sequence of characters enclosed by quotation marks.
(Ex: `"hello"`)

|Syntax
|Guidelines on how specific functions can be used.

|Variable
|An identifier used in a code file that refers to a specific location in memory.

|Whitespace
|Any part of the code that is left blank. This includes
