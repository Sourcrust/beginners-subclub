Computer Science is one of the hardest courses to get started on. Unlike
many other courses in primary/secondary school that usually have
textbooks, computer science has very few good starting points for those
who want to learn how to code. The purpose of this course is to help
people start coding. This course assumes that you have little to no
prior experience with coding. This beginner course will not teach you
everything, but it will teach you enough in order for you to be able to
learn more by yourself, either in the Advance Course, or online.

The main goal for the beginner course is to prepare you for the Canadian
Computing Competition, Junior Division, in February. In addition, it
will also prepare you for the advance course of the Computer Science
Club.

Even though this course will specifically focus on using C++, the
material that you will learn can be applied to **any** computer
language. If you are in grade 9 or 10, this course will prepare you for
the 11U & 12U Computer Science Course. The curriculum in this course
includes that of the 11U and the 12U Computer Science Courses.

Each meeting for the beginner course will be held on Fridays. That means
that there will be about nine lessons until the CCC. Since each lesson
will take 60-90 mins, this course will move more quickly than a typical
school course. That being said, I made a few documents that includes
everything that will be covered in the few months.

## Resources in this folder:

On the sidebar, you will see a list of lessons.
In the case you miss any lessons, or you want
to read ahead, this folder can be used. Currently, this folder is a work
in progress. Many chapters will be added on in the future. Expect to go
through 13 chapters/concepts in this course. If there are any sections
that come off as vague, or nonsense, leave a comment on the doc, and I
will revise and try to explain in more detail.

Note: There are more chapters in the doc than there are weeks before the
CCC. That means that this course will go through 2-3 chapters/concepts
per week.

There are many smaller docs that are filled with charts that you can
refer to. I would suggest reading the tutorial doc before referring to
these documents.

There is an [FAQ document](/resources/beginners/faq)
where I will put some responses to questions that are
important/frequently asked.

### Other Useful Resources:

 - All the syntax and commands that C++ offers can be found on [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/info/)

 - Info about the CCC can be found [here](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html)

## Ways to Problem Solve:

When you come across an error, **always try to find the errors yourself
first**. Here is a document filed with [common
errors](/resources/beginners/debugging-common-errors)
that beginners make in C++. Try to spend at least **10 mins** trying to
solve your problem before resorting to other means. Whenever you run
into an error in your code that you have no idea how to solve, there are
a few things that you can do.

 - Ask a friend. Itâ€™s normally easier to find mistakes in someone
   else's code than your own. Just make sure you **document your
   code** well enough so that your code is actually readable.

 - Google. **Google is your friend.** Many programmers will resort to
   Google if they run into a problem that they do not know how to
   solve. Many answers can be found on
   [*StackOverflow*](http://stackoverflow.com/), a forum that
   programmers use to ask questions on.

 - If you want to bug me, then you can contact me via email at
   [*markville.compsci@gmail.com*](mailto:markville.compsci@gmail.com)

As always, I will try to keep you updated on upcoming events. To stay
updated on any changes, refer to the [announcement
doc](https://docs.google.com/a/gapps.yrdsb.ca/document/d/1xMbT3W9PTNsSpDSrJT-Bf_9rE5rDmCSgQ_hyA8pFvME/edit?usp=sharing).
Of course, I may email any important information directly.

Hope that you will all enjoy this course! :)
